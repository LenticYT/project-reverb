# project-reverb
Free and Open-source operating system based on ReactOS.

Reverb is a Free and Open-source operating system.
It's based on ReactOS, but has two project goals.

  -> Speed
  Reverb is designed to be speedy from its first boot.
  
  ->Simplicity
  Unlike ReactOS, Reverb has only two themes: Watercolor and Classic.
  Also, Reverb has LibreOffice and Firefox pre-installed, so users don't have
  to worry about installing that. The ReactOS Application Manager has been
  completely removed, since users can download the software they need from the Internet.
